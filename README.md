# PoE Development Tools

(Development functions might be a better/more appropriate name)

PoE Development Tools is a set of tools for streamlining the PoE application development process by providing tools and functionality that many PoE apps need.

These tools generally refer too;

* Accessing the PoE official trade API.
* Accessing the PoE official stash API.
* Accessing the PoE wikia's (might be an official one) list of affix/prefix modifiers and other PoE item related information.

and will attempt to make getting the information that you need to your application as easily, painlessly and as quickly as possible. With prayers and hopes, this code should be easily modifiable to your exact needs if you need to change functionality for a specific use case.
